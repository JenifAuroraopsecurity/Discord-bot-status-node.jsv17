# Discord-bot-status-node.jsv17
Make your bot have 3 different statuses in 10 second intervals

This code should be inputted in `index.js`.
This code allows bot to show 3 statuses for example (Watching Jeni's home, Streaming Jeni's lofi stufy, Listening to Jeni's med lectures) - these are just an example, it is completely customisable.
